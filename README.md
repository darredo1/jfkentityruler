# jfkentityruler
This is a notebook for a project for creating character networks for books that promote JFK assassination conspiracy theories.

This notebook allows the user to ingest text, to cluster entities using a rule-based approach, and then to create a CSV output for nodes and edges to create a character network in a tool such as Gephi. 

A rule-based approach is note ideal for working with a corpus, even a small one like I have. You can see the length of the entity ruler. I am currently working on swith to an ML approach and hoping to use something like Bagpipes spaCy (https://github.com/wjbmattingly/bagpipes-spacy - by William J Mattingly), or BookNLP (https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp - by David Bamman).
